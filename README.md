# Artificial-Neural-Network

Artificial Neural Network, all fully connected layers, including forward propagation and backpropagation functions.

Using Relu function as activition function, which can be modified in activaion_func and activation_fcnp.

The layers are set in the list using the unit number such as [784,64,64,10]. 

the first is input layer, the last is output layer. Softmax and cross entropy is used.
